This repository's goal is to make a web interface to more easily triage, manage and respond to Github Issues.

## Set up

Have a MongoDB running
Run `npm install` to get the right packages
Then run `node app.js` to start the API server
Then you can run `smoethignsoetmhign` to do the Web Server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to interact with the website.

### Further set up
You can replace `defaultconfig.js` with your actual one once you want to go live.
