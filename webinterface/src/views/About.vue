            WebsiteName was created as a satire for crypto currency. It was
            created by <a href="www.craigloewen.com">Craig Loewen</a> and has
            the goal of making people more knowledgeable and informed about
            different aspects of crypto currency.

            By having it be free, and mineable only by clicking an online
            button, it seems... pretty silly to make a currency based off that
            interface. However, that's not totally different from Bitcoin
            mining. Really the only difference there is that your 'GPU' is
            clicking the button for you rather than you clicking it yourself.

            As well the supply for WebsiteName is infite. This is similar to
            DogeCoin, a popular cryptocurrency. DogeCoin already has people
            betting millions of dollars on it, and so if this website seems
            silly but DogeCoin seems legit you may need to rethink some of your
            assumptions.

            The last goal is to get people who are interested in crypto but
            maybe not tech savvy enough to go make their own node interested in
            the overall process, of mining and transaction fees and maybe
            helping them learn a bit more about crypto by using multichain. :)
